NEGOTIATION RESULTS:

AGENT PERSONALITIES:
- Alice: Practical, focuses on efficiency and avoiding conflicts
- Bob (Pappu): User's agent, advocates for user preferences but flexible
- Charlie: Detail-oriented, considers long-term scheduling implications

Generate a realistic 4-6 message negotiation conversation where agents:
1. Analyze why the original request doesn't work (if applicable)
2. Debate the pros/cons of different time slots
3. Reach consensus on the best option
4. Show actual decision-making reasoning

Format as JSON array:

    "message": "Looking at the calendars, the requested ${meetingRequest.preferred_time} on ${meetingRequest.preferred_date} has conflicts...",
    "reasoning": "Technical analysis of calendar conflicts",
