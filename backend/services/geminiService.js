        Today's date is ${currentDate}.

        IMPORTANT: Only schedule meetings on weekdays (Monday-Friday). If the user requests "tomorrow" and tomorrow is a weekend, 
        schedule for the next available weekday instead.

        Analyze the following transcript: "${transcript}"

        Extract the following information:
        1.  "title": The title of the meeting.
        2.  "preferred_date": The preferred date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. Infer from terms like "today", "tomorrow", or specific dates.
        3.  "preferred_time": The preferred time in "HH:MM" (24-hour) format.
        4.  "duration_minutes": The duration of the meeting in minutes. Default to 60 if not specified.
        5.  "specific_agent": If the user mentions meeting with a specific person (Alice, Bob, Charlie), extract their name. Otherwise, leave null for multi-agent scheduling.

        Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any other text or markdown formatting.
